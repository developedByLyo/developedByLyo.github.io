Privacy Policy 
Effective Date: 05/09/2025

The app is developed and maintained by Lyo. This policy explains how we handle your data when you use our mobile application.

1. Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or share personal information directly.

However, our app displays ads using Google AdMob, which may automatically collect:

Device information (such as model, OS version, unique identifiers)

Approximate location (to serve region-relevant ads)

Advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID)

See Google’s Privacy & Terms
 for more details.

2. How We Use Information

Data collected by AdMob is used only to display advertisements, either personalized or non-personalized (depending on your choice).

We do not sell, share, or use this data for any other purpose.

3. Consent & Your Choices

On first launch, you can choose whether to allow personalized ads.

You may change your preference at any time in the Settings section of the app.

If you do not give consent, you will still see non-personalized ads.

4. GDPR, CCPA, and Children’s Privacy

GDPR (EU users): You have the right to opt out of personalized ads at any time.

CCPA (California users): We do not sell personal data.

Children’s Privacy: Our app is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from them.

5. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Updates will be reflected with a new “Effective Date” at the top of this page.
